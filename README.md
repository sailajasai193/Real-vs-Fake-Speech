# Real-vs-Fake-Speech
This project aims to detect fake speech by extracting deep audio embeddings using the RawNet2 model, and then training machine learning classifiers to distinguish between bonafide (real) and spoofed (fake) speech samples. 
Used the ASVspoof 2019 dataset, the benchmark dataset for fake audio detection.
Extracted embeddings using the RawNet2 end-to-end anti-spoofing model.
Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers.
To measure the effectiveness of the  models:
    Accuracy
    Precision
    Recall
    F1-score
    Equal Error Rate (EER)
